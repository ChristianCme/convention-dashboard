    This page I think could compare 2 or 3 chapters side by side to compare stats and certain votes. 

    Ideas for charts/stats (not in this order):
    - Breakdowns for how the chapter swung for each vote as well as the difference between them and convention vote total
    - An average deviation between the chapter votes and the convention results
    - A count of how many ballots fit into each caucus (see Shane's 2021 analysis)
