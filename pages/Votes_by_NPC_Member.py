    This page I think could compare 2 or 3 NPC members (incoming and outgoing) side by side to compare stats and certain votes. (or maybe this could just be a big table)

    Ideas for charts/stats (not in this order):
    - Breakdowns for resolution votes
    - NPC Election Ballot
    - A count of how many ballots fit into each caucus (see Shane's 2021 analysis)
